HonDealz - Second-Hand Honda Motorcycle Price Prediction Application

Project Description
HonDealz is an Android application leveraging Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Mobile Development to predict second-hand Honda motorcycle prices (specifically Vario models). The app utilizes Machine Learning models to detect motorcycle types and provide price estimates.

Features
1. Motorcycle type detection using Machine Learning
2. Price prediction based on images and additional user-input data (e.g., mileage, documents)
3. Estimated price range display
4. Cloud integration for data storage and processing

How it Works
1. Users upload motorcycle images and input additional data.
2. The app detects motorcycle types using Machine Learning models.
3. The app calculates price estimates based on user-input data.
4. The app displays predicted price ranges.
